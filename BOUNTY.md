# Bug Bounty Program

We encourage community contributions to improve Dynamite Phishing. To reward responsible disclosure and high‑quality improvements, we run a transparent bounty program.

## Eligible Submissions
- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Remote code execution, privilege escalation, bypass of phishing detection.
- **High‑impact heuristics**: New detection rules that significantly reduce false negatives.
- **Privacy improvements**: Enhancements that strengthen local‑only analysis and prevent data leakage.
- **Documentation quality**: Clear, reproducible security guidelines or rule explanations.

## Rewards
- Critical vulnerability: $500 – $1,000
- High‑impact heuristic: $200 – $500
- Privacy improvement: $200 – $500
- Documentation quality: $50 – $200

(Amounts are indicative; final reward depends on severity, novelty, and quality.)

2. For heuristics or documentation, open a Pull Request with:
   - Clear description of the improvement
   - Test cases demonstrating effectiveness
   - Updated docs (`docs/rules.md`)

## Evaluation
